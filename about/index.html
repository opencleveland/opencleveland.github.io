    <h1>About Open Cleveland</h1>
    <p>We are an all volunteer group. Open Cleveland evolved out of the 2014 National Day of Civic Hacking. Open Cleveland is a group of people, first and foremost. We also call ourselves technologists, planners, designers, doers, thinkers, and activists. <a href="https://www.meetup.com/open-cleveland/">Every third Wednesday</a> we actively work together to improve the City of Cleveland and all of Northeast Ohio <a href="https://github.com/opencleveland">using open data and web technology</a> to support our efforts. We want to listen to you and build something together with you; not FOR you.
