    <h1>About Open Cleveland</h1>
    <p>We are a Code for America Brigade based in Cleveland, Ohio. Open Cleveland evolved out of the 2014 National Day of Civic Hacking. Open Cleveland is a group of people, first and foremost. We also call ourselves technologists, planners, designers, doers, thinkers, and activists. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/cleveland-civic-hacking/">Every third Wednesday</a> we actively work together to improve the City of Cleveland and all of Northeast Ohio often <a href="https://github.com/opencleveland">using technology</a> to support our efforts. By connecting people, organizations, resources, tools, and networks to build for Cleveland we will all thrive.</p>
