        <dt>What is your general view on <a href="https://data.clevelandohio.gov">government open data</a> as it relates to government transparency, accountability, and public participation in Cleveland?</dt>
        <dd><p>I applaud the progress Cleveland has made on enhancing data transparency, but I also have an
            extremely aggressive definition of “government transparency, accountability, and public
            participation” that demands not only more from our existing institutional efforts but also a
            commitment to fostering grassroots efforts that while may not originate from inside city
            government are still certainly encouraged and empowered.</p>

            <p>
                Comprehensive data is not just about the technical ability to produce a data catalog but also
must include a consideration about both data literacy and access for residents. One of the
reasons I decided to run for political office is because I have a problem with the ways electeds
often try to shame voters for not getting involved because I think it wrongly shifts the blame to
the residents while ignoring the behavior of those in power.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Open Data Portal is a tremendous accomplishment, but having talked to thousands of Ward
7 residents many speak to both not having the time to dive into all the resources available and
feeling overwhelmed about all the various conclusions that one could derive from what is
shared. I would argue there is another level of outreach and engagement that is required to help
achieve the Open Data Portal’s first primary reason to “increase transparency & trust in City
operations.” If that is an outcome we are in pursuit of, then we cannot view the ability to create
and share an Open Data Portal as the only step towards improving government transparency,
accountability, and public participation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cleveland’s voter turnout in 2024 was 47%, as compared to Ohio’s overall which was over 70%.
If we use this citizen participation metric as a measurement of trust in city government, then we
are severely failing as public servants, and it arguably has nothing to do with our ability to
produce data catalogs. Or to quote a line from the book Democratizing Inequalities, which
includes a focus on Cleveland: “Is our society more open and democratic? Or is elite rule
reorganized to accommodate greater openness and participation without disruptioning
hierarchies and power relations?”
            </p>

        </dd>
        <dt>How have you used the <a href="https://data.clevelandohio.gov">City’s Open Data Portal</a> to obtain information?</dt>
        <dd> <p>
            Yes, both as a resident and as a candidate.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy being able to incorporate the resources into various talking points with the residents as
we further discuss the advocacy they hope to see from their next city council. These
conversations with residents have also led to discoveries within the Open Data Catalog that I
didn’t even know existed. A few datasets that I’ve been able to pay more attention to during the
campaign:
        </p>
        <p>
           <i>Lead Safe Certificate Explorer</i> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Part of my campaign platform includes a commitment to reenvisioning Cleveland’s infrastructure
according to promoting public health, and that includes lead-free communities. While Cleveland
has the most kids with high lead levels as compared to similar cities like Columbus, Cincinnati,
Toledo, and Akron, the highest rates in the new Ward 7 community are in the Detroit-Shoreway
neighborhood.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, as many residents have shared with me over the course of the campaign, the Lead
Safe Certificates only tell one part of the overall lead poisoning story. In fact, there have been
instances where a child has tested positive for lead, even in a home with a lead-safe certificate
which is a problem that must be addressed immediately. While the purpose of the Open Data
Portal is primarily to provide access to and interaction with government data, and not
necessarily to ensure compliance, it serves as an important example of why we must not
confuse outputs, which are the immediate results of an effort, with outcomes, which are the
broader changes that result from those efforts.

            Workforce Program Enrollments - Greater Cleveland Works
        </i></p>
            <p>
                Strong labor and workforce development is a core piece of my Flexible Development priority. I
have approached this commitment from two angles.The first of which is focused on ensuring I
am aware of the available workforce development programs that exist – who their contacts are,
how their programs work, etc. – so that I can properly connect residents to these opportunities.
And the other focus is on whether residents are actually participating and benefiting from these
existing programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                This dataset gives me a glimpse into one measure of how Ward 7 residents demonstrate their
interest and compatibility with this particular area of programming. This has led to some
fantastic conversations with Ward Stakeholders, advocates, Block Clubs, and residents about
collaborative efforts to support targeted outreach and information sessions for residents in the
most need of workforce development opportunities. What this particular dataset also reveals is
information about those who exit the program, or who arguably may have viewed the program
as ineffective or incompatible—a metric that if relevant then I certainly want to explore
immediate solutions to increase participation and success.
            </p>

            <p><i>
                Mayoral Appointments to Boards & Commissions
            </i></p>
            <p>
                This is a dataset I did not know existed until recently though feels slightly incomplete in terms of
providing information about the particular Appointee. Without information on whether the
Appointee is employed and with whom, whether they have any active contracts with the city, or
even information about their local political campaign contributions, I would argue this list of
Appointees again provides only a glimpse into what residents cite wanting to learn more about,
which is who gets access to power in the city of Cleveland.
            </p>
            </dd>
        <dt>In your opinion, does the City of Cleveland currently provide enough open, standardized data in a digital format? What kinds of government information or specific data sets would you like to see made more available? </dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Again, open, standardized data in digital format should be viewed as the minimum because
                open and transparent data should also be evaluated according to how – not just whether – the
                city responds to public records requests and cooperates with Freedom Of Information Act
                (FOIA) requests.</p>

                <p>Open, standardized data in digital format is only one factor and assumes everyone has the
                    same experience when it comes to reading and analyzing complex datasets. For me, it is about
                    access to government information, as opposed to data sets, that I would specifically like to see
                    more of, and so this criticism gets more at Cleveland’s culture with transparency, accountability,
                    and conflict than anything technical.</p>

                    <p>
                        There are well-documented delays regarding the city’s history of responding to public records
requests. Investigative reporting and even court rulings report residents waiting months,
sometimes hundreds of days, for basic information. This undermines transparency,
accountability, and public participation because timely access to a response from the
government is as important as the data. A stronger commitment to prompt responses, proactive
disclosure of commonly requested records, and an open culture of information-sharing is
needed if Cleveland wants to build trust with residents and meet its obligations under the public
records law.
                    </p>
                    <p>If government officials feel less inclined to interact with questions from residents because they
                        simply direct them to the Open Data Portal, then this tool is no longer helpful but actually
                        harmful to government-resident relations. Data cannot replace relationships and interactions,
                        even if some of those interactions are quite negative for the elected official. We cannot hide
                        behind complex datasets while ignoring our duty to meet every resident where they are at.</p>

        <dt>What are your approach towards privacy, safety, and budget concerns in implementing technologies 
            like Spotshotter and surveillance cameras ? (<a href="https://igchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Chicago-Police-Departments-Use-of-ShotSpotter-Technology.pdf">A 2021 City of Chicago Investigatory Report</a> found that<i> “CPD responses to 
            ShotSpotter alerts rarely produce documented evidence of a gun-related crime, investigatory stop, or recovery of a firearm.”</i> [pg. 4] ? What will you prioritize ?</dt>
         <dd> <p>
            I am against mass surveillance programs, which includes Spotshotter, for a long list of reasons,
including that these programs have yet to prove themselves effective and are a serious threat to
residents’ civil liberties. While ARPA funds and not general operating funds were used for
Cleveland’s pilot program, my commitment to civil liberties and fiscal responsibility means I will
fight to stop attempts to renew the city’s contract with Spotshotter or enter into any new
contracts with mass surveillance technology.
         </p>
 <p>
    It is imperative that we don’t fool ourselves into thinking it’s technology that will make us safer,
especially if we are simultaneously unwilling to address the root causes of crime. If housing,
healthcare, food, and opportunity aren’t available for residents, then an expensive digital
monitor has no impact on improving safety in our communities. Residents want us operating
according to how we can prevent crime and suffering rather than simply respond to it. The use
of unproven surveillance technologies like ShotSpotter, which have failed to demonstrate
meaningful impact on public safety and instead divert resources away from proven community
investments while posing serious threats to civil liberties.
 </p>
 <p>
    I believe the more an administration spends on mass surveillance programs the less likely they
are to invest in a Cleveland Police Department that is first and foremost in compliance with the
consent decree while also being appropriately staffed, with protected pensions.
 </p>
         </dd>
        <dt>What are your views on the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement ? Do you support its prohibition? Do you believe that residents or businesses should be encouraged or required to share footage from their security video cameras (e.g. Ring) ?</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>
                I do not support the use of facial recognition technology. Given that the city has already suffered
several cyberattacks in recent years, I believe our government should be prioritizing strong data
security infrastructure rather than expanding surveillance, which is part of my Accessible City
Services campaign priority. Breaches of biometric databases are particularly dangerous
because they are irreversible because unlike a password you cannot change your face once it
has been compromised. Any breaches in city infrastructure are permanent and erode trust in
government.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also believe that any requests for private security footage should be subject to subpoenas or
similar court supervision. This ensures that the protection of individual liberties is not left to
discretionary enforcement, but is safeguarded through due process and judicial oversight. I
have concerns about the different ways our city may define “encouraged” and “required” when
referring to the process of sharing footage from security video cameras. Residents and small
business owners have shared stories about willingly sharing footage with law enforcement, but
this isn’t something that I believe the government should play a role in “encouraging” and
certainly not “requiring.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Something I believe to be a more effective use of energy and resources than facial recognition
                technology is deliberate, proactive outreach with the local corner shops, gas stations, and
                convenience stores in the ward to discuss how they can promote safety and improve relations
                with residents. These conversations often start with how stores may inadvertently contribute to
                crime and lead to practical solutions like better lighting, litter cleanup, and harm reduction
                measures, as well as discussions on product offerings that reflect community needs. Many of
                these shops are run by immigrant and refugee families who receive limited support and are
                often the scapegoat for public safety issues and are vilified by the administration. I don’t believe
                we can vilify our way to public safety, and so having these conversations with these small
                business owners as the councilperson, in collaboration with law enforcement, leads to much
                more productive solutions that ideally help heal tensions between corner stores and residents.    
            </p>

        <dt>Internet access is critical for economic growth and educational advancement. Do you believe every Northeast Ohio resident must have affordable access to universal high-speed internet of at least 50 megabits per second (Mbps) (aka broadband) where they live, work or play? If so, how will you address this?</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>
                Yes, I firmly believe that every resident should have access to reliable high-speed internet. The
City of Cleveland has made efforts to address this important issue by working with DigitalC to
offer a more cost effective internet option for residents. And while I think this is an important way
to address this issue, I’m eager to see upcoming reports on DigitalC’s efforts to expand their
reach. Last year, DigitalC failed to meet their goal set out by the city resulting in a $1 million loss
in funds from City Council, however as of April this year they seem to be on track, and so I will
be paying close attention to the upcoming report.
            </p>
            <p>
                The important part here is not the focus on the failure of DigitalC last year to meet its goals, but
how we can improve our ability to connect every resident to affordable, reliable, high-speed
internet. City council plays a key role in ensuring the government’s contracts with various
partners result in an effective use of taxpayer dollars and necessary improvements for the
residents. Having knocked on over 5,000 doors, I can play a constructive role in outreach here,
which includes ensuring residents have information about DigitalC’s program. But on council, I
intend to monitor the effectiveness of these programs very closely, as it is the residents who
suffer when local governments fail to provide necessary oversight.
            </p>


         </dd>

        <dt>What measures do you support to increase cooperation between city departments, especially in regards to data sharing?</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>
                The best way for me to answer this question pertains to my Accessible City Services campaign
priority, which is that residents want to see their hard-earned tax dollars translate into well-run
services for all.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thousands of Ward 7 residents describe everyday challenges that they experience in
                Cleveland, and many have successfully identified that certain problems exist because our city
                has a tendency to operate in fragmented silos. So many times during this campaign I have
                encountered someone who is working on something that another person I met at an earlier
                event is also trying to work on, but neither knew of each other.   
            </p>

            <p>
                As a compliance professional with much experience in audit-related activities, I regularly engage
with stakeholders about spotting gaps, streamlining processes, and strengthening coordination
across departments. I plan to bring this experience to city hall to promote more accountability
that will assist departments in working together more effectively to deliver better services for
residents.
            </p>


         </dd>
        <dt>What else should we know for your plans around increasing government transparency, open data, and digital equality?</dt>
         <dd>
<p>
    My first campaign commitment is Accessibility for Residents, and while this commitment
    certainly includes supporting and celebrating governmental tools like the Open Data Portal, it also includes enhancing and strengthening Cleveland’s public comment. I consider public
    comment a reflection of how our city views conflict, including negative feedback. While receiving
    negative feedback is not fun, it is part of the role as the residents’ representative, and therefore
    must be respected.
</p>

<p>
    During advocacy for a ceasefire resolution for Palestine, instead of listening to their residents
    Cleveland City Council decided to limit public participation by adding additional restrictions to
    public comment such as changing the methods for comment selection, blocking off the first few
    rows in council chambers, and increasing police presence. I’m running for city council to be a
    strong voice for the residents of Ward 7, and what City Council chose to do then was to silence
    the voices of advocates and constituents who were utilizing their democratic right to give
    testimony in front of their elected leaders.
</p>
        <p>
            I have spoken often on this campaign about how I want to encourage healthy disagreement on
City Council and that means both between the council members as well as those who give
public comment. There is no government transparency or accountability when those in the
government actively seek to silence the voices that they serve.
        </p>
         </dd>
        <dt>As a gesture of your commitment to open data, are you willing to release your campaign's financial disclosure statement in a machine-readable format (e.g. CSV, EXCEL etc) on your campaign website?</dt>
         <dd><p>Yes, I would also welcome working with Open Cleveland, a talented group of local advocates
            who have immense experience in data transparency, to help democratize campaign data in local
            elections.</p></dd>
