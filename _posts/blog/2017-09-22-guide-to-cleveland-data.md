# A guide for local Cleveland open data

What is open civic data? Open Civic Data (generally just referred as Open Data) is quantative data about a municipality's functions, qualities, services, its people, and physical infrastructure. The [Sunlight Foundation](<https://sunlightfoundation.com/2013/09/16/your-guidelines-to-open-data-guidelines-pt-2-stages-of-development/) and [Open Knowledge International's Open Data Handbook](<http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/) are two sources that explain more. 


If you want to do anything useful with the data, the data has to be "open": able to be obtained freely and in bulk (no saving a file six hundred times) , "machine-readable" - in a file format that is friendly to work with and whose content can be deciphered by computer programs easily and to be legally able to use and share with minimal or no restrictions. 


When we want data about our city, where do we start? First, ASK the agency that you think would have the data (Advice on that in a later post). 


[The US Census](https://www.census.gov/data.html) is a comprehensive source of data about our city specifically on our population and demographics. 


Cities across the USA have dedicated websites (data portals). Unfortunately, Cleveland doesn't have one. In this absence, different entities have aggregated or collected this data or perhaps the govt agency that produces or acts as a steward for this data may publish it themselves.
