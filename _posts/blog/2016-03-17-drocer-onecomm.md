Open Cleveland is excited to announce that we have been named the winner in OneCommunity's Data Curation Challenge! http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Cleveland-Data-Curation-Group/events/229410937/

**Our project, drocer, is creating a searchable archive of [The City Record](http://clevelandcitycouncil.org/the-city-record/), a weekly digest of Cleveland City Council's activities including proposals and votes of legislation, bid announcements for city contracts, Public Notices, Board of Zoning Appeals, known as the City Record.  and only available as a PDF.**

An overview of drocer is available at: 
[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bWo-yJD3pR07EaR75p-ksKdHUyiPcyAmGf3h7L9i4Ps/edit#slide=id.p](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bWo-yJD3pR07EaR75p-ksKdHUyiPcyAmGf3h7L9i4Ps/edit#slide=id.p)

In recent months, we've met with community partners including the Cleveland Public Library, the City Council's Clerk of Courts, and the City's Law Department to get a handle on what it will take to bring this tool to the greatest number of Clevelanders, understand what features are needed and how they can get involved, and enabling Clevelanders find out what City Council did. 

For more tech saavy and curious readers who interested in analyzing the plain text that we've extracted from PDFs, you can view the code that we've written to begin parsing and structuring the data that we've extracted from the city, 

See [https://github.com/opencleveland/drocer](https://github.com/opencleveland/drocer)

Our first step, extracting the raw text from the PDFs is completed! 

Next steps: 
parsing and structuring the data so that it can be useful to; 
facilitating the usage of the to help create of the data that we opened. 

We've only started and the best is yet to come.
