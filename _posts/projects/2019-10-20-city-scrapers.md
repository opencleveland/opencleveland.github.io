[City Scrapers](https://cityscrapers.org/docs/introduction/#city-bureau-city-scrapers-and-the-documenters-program) is a Python-based webkit that scrapes government websites to find out when and where public board meetings are held. 

City Scrapers complements [theDocumenters.org](https://www.documenters.org/), an initiative by City Bureau that pays local residents to attend and report on what happens at local government meetings.

City Scrapers' data [will be used to create a centralized calendar of upcoming government meetings](https://cityscrapers.org/docs/introduction/#city-bureau-city-scrapers-and-the-documenters-program). 

The Cleveland Foundation [funded an initial launch of City Scrapers in Cleveland](https://www.citybureau.org/notebook/2019/9/4/making-local-government-more-accessible-in-northeast-ohio) 
which created over 80 scrapers (https://github.com/City-Bureau/city-scrapers-cle) for Cuyahoga County and the City of Cleveland. 

In May 2020, [the Cleveland Foundation provided funding for a one year launch of the Cleveland Documenters](http://neighborupcle.org/cledocumenters/) program. 

## Near and Long Term Goals:
* Working with [NeighborUP CLE, the local partner of Documenters in Cleveland](http://neighborupcle.org/) to provide technical assistance for updating and writing scrapers. 

* Learn more local communities and organizations are and how they want to be 
informed about government meetings. 


### Where we are now: 

The great folks at City Bureau [have written scrapers for over 80 governmental organizations and bodies in Cleveland and Cuyahoga County](https://github.com/City-Bureau/city-scrapers-cle). 

[A calendar displaying the upcoming meetings](https://city-bureau.github.io/city-scrapers-events-oh/) has also been made by City Bureau too. 

If and the code and structure of a city government changes, our scraper will need to be updated. 

The Documenters program is planning to begin sending 'reporters' to meetings in September.
