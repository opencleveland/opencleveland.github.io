City Scrapers is a python-based webkit to scrape government and non-profit websites to find out when and where their board meetings are held. 

City Scrapers is a compliment to the [Documenters](https://www.documenters.org/) (Documenters has not launched in Cleveland); a website that pays people to attend and report on what happens at a government agency board meeting. 

The Cleveland Foundation [funded a Cleveland portion of City Scrapers](https://www.citybureau.org/notebook/2019/9/4/making-local-government-more-accessible-in-northeast-ohio) in the fall of 2019. 


## Near and Long Term Goals:
* Determine how the public is using this and support it so that it can be used. 
* Figure out whether the Documenters will be implemented in Cleveland. 
* 

### Where we are now:
