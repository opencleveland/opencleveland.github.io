Parking is forbidden on certain Cleveland streets when there is more than 2 inches of snow on the ground. Some streets subject to this rule don't have a sign stating this law. 

The city originally published a non-searchable PDF of these streets. [Here's the original project idea and context behind the project](https://github.com/opencleveland/general/issues/13) 

We made a map to visually show where these streets. It's available to view at [http://opencleveland.github.io/snowban](http://opencleveland.github.io/snowban)

### Where we are now: 
* Done (Feb. 2016)
* December 2017 - [the city of Cleveland published an official map](https://twitter.com/CityofCleveland/status/940587010452086785)
