### Partner 
City of Cleveland Land Bank

A website to view vacant lots in the City of Cleveland eligible for homeowners to purchase the vacant lot next door to them.

Before this project, residents who wanted to find out whether the vacant lot next door to them was available, had to call City Hall. If the resident was interested to purchase and learn about the program, they would have to obtain information from City Hall, then go downtown to obtain an application and then submit the application in person at City Hall.

clevelandlots.org allows you to do all of this online.
