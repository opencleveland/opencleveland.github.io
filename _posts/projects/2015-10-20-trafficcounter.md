excerpt: hardware traffic counter to measure quantity, speed of vehicles on road

Update: Spring 2017: 
**Project is not actively worked on . You are welcome to adopt this and lead this project. 

[At TCAMP in October 2016](http://www.opencleveland.org/blog/TCAMP-recap/), a couple attendees discussed of how to measure the quantity, speeds, and types of vehicles traveling on a road. Building on work of http://tomorrow-lab.com/product23; they were 
able to get a prototype working using an arduino. 

## Long Term Goals:

Currently, theyâ€™re running experiments to validate and fine-tune vehicle counting and speed detection. Next, they hope to add estimation of vehicle types (cars, semis, pedestrians) to the codebase and create a user guide to help less tech-savvy people assemble counters, and upload their data to a public repository.

Eventually, the group hopes to make ready-to-use counters available through local libraries and community organizations, and install a number of permanent counters which can automatically collect and submit data.


### Where we are now: 

* Working prototype available
* 
* 

### How you can help: 

* Refine working prototype (ask [Josh K](https://twitter.com/jkruszyn) for current barriers, problems with the traffic counter)
* Connect with alternative transportation organizations (Bike Cleveland, and NOACA) to confirm their interest and awareness (no formal contact has been made)
