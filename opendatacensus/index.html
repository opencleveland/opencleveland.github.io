    <h1>Open Data Census</h1>


    <p>An important aspect of the work of Open Cleveland is highlighting access to local government data. Code for America, Sunlight Foundation, and the Open Knowledge Foundation launched the <a href="http://us-cities.survey.okfn.org/">U.S. City Open Data Census</a> in 2014 
    as a tool for cities and community members to compare the openness of local government data relative to other US cities. </p>


    <p> Any community member can contribute to the Open Data Census by submitting a request that will be reviewed for accuracy. The <a href="http://us-cities.survey.okfn.org/place/cleveland">Open Data Census</a> for Cleveland gives a picture of the openness of local data as it looks today and will evolve over time. Submissions from the local community are welcome.</p>

    <p>A <a href="http://us-city.census.okfn.org/">previous version of the census from U.S. City Open Data Census 2014 to 2017 
    </a>is still available </p>
