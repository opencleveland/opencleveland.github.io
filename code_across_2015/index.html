    <h1>Code Across Cleveland 2015</h1>
    <p>During the weekend of Feb. 20-22, we're celebrating International Data Day in Cleveland.</p>

    <h2>What's Code Across ?</h2>
	
	<p>A weekend of civic events across the country where technologists and community partners connect to tackle local challenges by adapting existing solutions and building new ones with technology and open data.</p>
	
	<p>Ideas we'll discuss:</p>
	
	<p>• See a live demonstration of Large Lots, a website for people to find and buy City-owned vacant lot, streamlining the process.</p>
	<p>• Create a searchable index of Cleveland City Council's legislation and updates.</p>
	<p>• Use RTA's newly released real-time data to give up-to-date bus schedules.</p>
	<p>• Add your own ideas for civic apps!</p>
	
	Learn: 
	
	What's open data and civic hacking all about? 
	
	Is Open Cleveland for you?
	
	If you have an idea of a project that can help improve a local government or have developed a civic app?
	
	If you're a local govt official or employee, share your experiences with data sharing in your workplace and find out how you can share the data that's available to you and promote open data policies there can help lower costs, streamline citizens' public requests, and more.
	
	So, come join developers, designers, data geeks, civic leaders, organizers, idea-makers, and anyone else who is interested to learn about our brigade.
	
	Programming experience is not necessary!
	
	A laptop is encouraged but not required.
